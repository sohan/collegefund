<h1>ConnectForEdu Privacy Policy:</h1>

<p>Your privacy is important to us.  At ConnectForEdu, we have a few key principles that govern how we handle information that you submit to us:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We don’t ask for information from you unless it is absolutely necessary for the donation process.</li>
  <li>Outside of information that you choose to submit for your public profile and Track Record, we do not store your information on our servers.</li>
  <li>We do not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or facilitate the donation transaction process.</li>
  <li>Any information that you provide to ConnectForEdu is your own property and will not be used in ways not specified in this privacy policy</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these principles.  For the purposes of this policy, we will refer to any participant or applicant who intends to post their information in order to request donations for student loans as Recipients, and any participant who wishes to donate to the Recipients as Donors:</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, ConnectForEdu collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ConnectForEdu’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ConnectForEdu’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ConnectForEdu may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>ConnectForEdu also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on registered Recipient blogs. ConnectForEdu only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to ConnectForEdu’s websites choose to interact with ConnectForEdu in ways that require ConnectForEdu to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ConnectForEdu gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For Recipient applications and screening, we ask applicants to provide a username, their real name, their email address, education and professional background (as would be included in a resume), most updated FAFSA, student loan amount at the time of application, student loan account number, and a copy of their student loan paperwork as proof of loan debt. For Donors interested in making donations who wish to create a profile, we ask for a username, an email address, and any contact information that they wish to provide.  In each case, ConnectForEdu collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ConnectForEdu. ConnectForEdu does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.  ConnectForEdu will not disclose Recipient student loan account information or FAFSA information (including the Recipient’s social security information) to any persons outside of ConnectForEdu employees or board members without the consent of the Recipient except in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ConnectForEdu believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ConnectForEdu, third parties or the public at large.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
<p>ConnectForEdu may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, ConnectForEdu may monitor the most popular Recipient blogs or use certain Recipient information (that does not directly identify their student loan account information) to identify trends in donations. ConnectForEdu may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ConnectForEdu does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>ConnectForEdu discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ConnectForEdu’s behalf or to provide services available at ConnectForEdu’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. By using ConnectForEdu’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. ConnectForEdu will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ConnectForEdu discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when ConnectForEdu believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ConnectForEdu, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an ConnectForEdu website and have supplied your email address, ConnectForEdu may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features/profiles, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ConnectForEdu and our services. However, we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ConnectForEdu takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. ConnectForEdu uses cookies to help ConnectForEdu identify and track visitors, their usage of ConnectForEdu website, and their website access preferences. ConnectForEdu visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ConnectForEdu’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of ConnectForEdu’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h2>Business Transfers</h2>
<p>If ConnectForEdu, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that ConnectForEdu goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ConnectForEdu may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h2>Ads</h2>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ConnectForEdu and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Comments and other content submitted to our Recipient blogs are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, ConnectForEdu may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in ConnectForEdu’s sole discretion. ConnectForEdu encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
